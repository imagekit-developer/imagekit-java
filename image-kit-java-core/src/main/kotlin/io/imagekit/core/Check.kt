This SDK requires a minimum Jackson version of $MINIMUM_JACKSON_VERSION, but the following incompatible Jackson versions were detected at runtime:

${incompatibleJacksonVersions.asSequence().map { (version, incompatibilityReason) ->
    "- `${version.toFullString().replace("/", ":")}` ($incompatibilityReason)"
}.joinToString("\n")}

This can happen if you are either:
1. Directly depending on different Jackson versions
2. Depending on some library that depends on different Jackson versions, potentially transitively

Double-check that you are depending on compatible Jackson versions.

See https://www.github.com/imagekit-developer/imagekit-java#jackson for more information.
